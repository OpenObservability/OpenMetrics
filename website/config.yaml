    OpenMetrics is the official standard for metrics in the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) ecosystem. With its support for examplars, it ties metrics and traces as closely and efficiently as never seen before. The [specification](https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics/blob/main/specification/OpenMetrics.md) covers semantics, data model, and wire format for cloud-native metrics at scale, with support for both text representation and Protocol Buffers.
