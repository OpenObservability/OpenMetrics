Current Prometheus text format (0.0.4)

Official docs: https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/
Old working document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TapRdI5Tu2e8AIqREtdv_C36t4GGsDQr64KixE-gWu8/edit#

Basic format looks like:
# HELP http_requests_total The total number of HTTP requests.
# TYPE http_requests_total counter
http_requests_total{method="post",code="200"} 1027 1395066363000
http_requests_total{method="post",code="400"}    3 1395066363000

# Escaping in label values:
msdos_file_access_time_seconds{path="C:\\DIR\\FILE.TXT",error="Cannot find file:\n\"FILE.TXT\""} 1.458255915e9

# Minimalistic line:
metric_without_timestamp_and_labels 12.47

# A weird metric from before the epoch:
something_weird{problem="division by zero"} +Inf -3982045

# A histogram, which has a pretty complex representation in the text format:
# HELP http_request_duration_seconds A histogram of the request duration.
# TYPE http_request_duration_seconds histogram
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.05"} 24054
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.1"} 33444
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.2"} 100392
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"} 129389
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="1"} 133988
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="+Inf"} 144320
http_request_duration_seconds_sum 53423
http_request_duration_seconds_count 144320

# Finally a summary, which has a complex representation, too:
# HELP rpc_duration_seconds A summary of the RPC duration in seconds.
# TYPE rpc_duration_seconds summary
rpc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.01"} 3102
rpc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.05"} 3272
rpc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.5"} 4773
rpc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.9"} 9001
rpc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.99"} 76656
rpc_duration_seconds_sum 1.7560473e+07
rpc_duration_seconds_count 2693
 
 
Notes, some of them Prometheus-specific:
Metric names are [a-zA-Z_:][a-zA-Z0-9_:]*
Label names are [a-zA-Z0-9_]*
Label values are full utf-8, null bytes are permitted
Metrics should not be exposed with colons, that's for end user use for aggregation by convention
Counter metrics end in _total by convention, counters start at 0 and only go up
Gauges do not have a suffix by convention, can go up and down
All values are float64
\n is the line terminator
There's no required ordering on label names, however for performance reasons a consistent ordering is encouraged
Histogram values are cumulative, so the le="0.5" bucket includes the values in the previous buckets
The reasoning behind this is that you can remove buckets and still have things work. This is intended to allow for abuse mitigation if someone adds too many buckets.
The values in the le and quantile labels are float64.
The quantile label can have values from 0 to 1.
The le label can be any non-NaN value, which means _sum isn't actually a counter.
I, Brian, am not a fan of this and would prefer to restrict it to nonnegative values only
The spec says these must be provided in increasing order
Summaries are quantiles, not percentiles
This is a general Prometheus best practice, we deal with things in seconds/bytes/ratios and leave converting to something more human readable at the display layer. This convention is to avoid a mix of units.
_sum and _count of histograms/summaries aren't always present, due to some instrumentation libraries not supporting them.
_count of a histogram is always the same as the +Inf bucket.
TYPE and HELP
Are optional
Are currently discarded by Prometheus
If they are stored, conflicts must be handled (last one wins, etc)
There's a "untyped" TYPE for when you don't know if something is a counter or gauge
+Inf, -Inf and NaN are supported
There is a specified MIME type
By convention, metrics are exposed on /metrics - though this is often not followed
We're starting to add support for selecting specific time series via a url parameter ?name[]=timeseries, currently only supported in Python and Java
 
There's also a number of other conventions/best practices/patterns about how to expose time series to be as useful as possible to query in Prometheus, though the principles should largely apply to other systems too. These range from simple things like always putting units in the metric name (preferably base units like seconds), to things that depend on PromQL features such as how to handle non-identity labels you might want to use with a target for things like version numbers.
 
Places it could be improved in general:
There's slightly different escaping rules for label names and HELP - we should unify this
Whitespace (spaces or tabs) can appear in any number between tokens - this should be tightened up
Timestamps can be appended to this as millisecond integers - fractional seconds would be better to allow for other precisions and be more consistent with Prometheus generally.
Specify exactly which spellings of +Inf/-Inf/Inf/NaN are allowed - probably all of them, case insensitive. Different languages produce different capitalizations and don't always have the + for +Inf.
Should we worry about float parsing being otherwise consistent? We haven't run into any issues yet…
Adding an end marker, to help detect if the response got cut off
Users forgetting the final \n is not uncommon when hand-assembling the format, is there anything we can do there?
 
 
 
Potential expansions
 
There are things which the format currently doesn't do, that have been talked about. Here's some of them:
 
It'd be nice to keep the new format parseable by a Prometheus 0.0.4 parser
The behaviour of Prometheus when a time series is exposed multiple times with different timestamps is explicitly undefined, we'll need to specify this (likely sorted oldest first)
If multiple values at different timestamps are supported, compressing them, e.g. into one line, might make sense
Let's figure out semantics first, micro-optimisations can come later
Timestamp precision other than milliseconds
Expose as an integer with fractional seconds/float64?
What should we do about before 1970?
64 bit integer support
Do we want int64 or uint64? Both?
Anyone reading this: Are there any use cases for large, high-precision negative integers?
Do we need to indicate to the backend which type a value is (e.g. 0 vs 0.0)?
If we don’t, what happens when the backend “suddenly” gets float64 when it could assume it was [u]int64, before
Gracefully handling this for systems that only support more limited types
If we know it's a Counter, can we take it mod 2^53 in systems that only support float64?
128 bit float/integer support
Once CPUs support 128 bits natively, it’s natural to expand the format. Should this simply be a breaking change (semvar major) or otherwise anticipated?
We're using text, so it'll Just Work I imagine
Boolean support
Prometheus convention is false=0, true=1.
Do we need to add tokens for this, or can we just stick to the convention?
Special values
Prometheus 2.0 has a special "stale" value used internally (it's a NaN with a particular bit pattern) which we may wish to expose to other Prometheus servers. Is this something we should allow (if we end up wanting it), or just keep as a Prometheus-specific extension?
String support
Debate around whether a first class string value should be added
One idea is around annotations, that are not part of times series identity
Would these go with a metric or a time series?
What are the use cases for these? Are they more log-like?
The approach at https://www.robustperception.io/how-to-have-labels-for-machine-roles/ may be an option for annotations
Gauge with value 1 and a label for each piece of information
Enum use case, string with limited number of values
Gauge with one time series per potential value, with 0/1 values?
Byte string support
Influx have received a small number of requests for this over the years, not inclined to support it currently
Are there additional metadata fields beyond HELP/TYPE that we should hCan ave?
