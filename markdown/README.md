# OpenMetrics

OpenMetrics is a working group to determine a standard for exposing metrics
data, influenced by the [Prometheus exposition
format](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/).

Discussion of the standard is happening in the
[issues](https://github.com/RichiH/OpenMetrics/issues) on this repository and in bi-weekly meetings; invitation upon request and after basic vetting.
